Installation from Github
========================
py-lmd has been tested with **Python 3.8 and 3.9**.
To install the py-lmd library clone the Github repository and use pip to install the library in your current environment.
It is recommended to use the library with a conda environment. Please make sure that the package is installed editable
like described. Otherwise static glyph files might not be available. 

We recommend installing the non-python dependencies with conda before installing py-lmd:

```
git clone https://github.com/MannLabs/py-lmd

conda create -n "py-lmd-env"
conda activate py-lmd-env
conda install python=3.9 scipy 'scikit-image>=0.19' numpy numba -c conda-forge
pip install -e .

```

If you are installing on an M1 apple silicon Mac you will need to install `numba` via conda instead of pip before proceeding with the installation of the py-lmd library.

```
conda install numba
```
